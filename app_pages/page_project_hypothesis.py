        f"* We believe that by looking at different features we can with a \
        good degree of accuracy differentiates between benign or malignant \
        tumours. For this model, we would need the accuracy to be above 90% as\
        stated in the business requirements.\n"
        f"* This analysis aims to observe which features are most helpful in \
        predicting malignant or benign cancer and to see general trends that \
        may aid us in model selection and hyperparameter selection. The goal \
        is to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant. To \
        achieve this, I have used machine learning classification methods to \
        fit a function that can predict the discrete class of new input. \n\n"
        f"* This hypothesis will be validated through the testing and \
        graphical evaluation of the generated model, specifically logging its \
        validation accuracy and loss between epochs, as well as creating a \
        confusion matrix between the two outcomes.\n"
        f"* If these two hypotheses are validated, the client can use the \
        insights offered by conventional data analysis to aid in getting a \
        diagnosis quickly and with a high degree of accuracy.\n"
