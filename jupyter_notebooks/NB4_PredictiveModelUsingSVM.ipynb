    "As discussed in notebook [NB3](https://github.com/ShiroJean/Breast-cancer-risk-prediction/blob/master/NB3_DataPreprocesing.ipynb) splitting the data into test and training sets is crucial to avoid overfitting. This allows generalization of real, previously-unseen data. Cross-validation extends this idea further. Instead of having a single train/test split, we specify **so-called folds** so that the data is divided into similarly-sized folds. \n",

    "* Training occurs by taking all folds except one – referred to as the holdout sample. \n",
    "* On the completion of the training, you test the performance of your fitted model using the holdout sample. \n",

    "* The holdout sample is then thrown back with the rest of the other folds, and a different fold is pulled out as the new holdout sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Training is repeated again with the remaining folds and we measure performance using the holdout sample. This process is repeated until each fold has had a chance to be a test or holdout sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The expected performance of the classifier, called cross-validation error, is then simply an average of error rates computed on each holdout sample. \n",
