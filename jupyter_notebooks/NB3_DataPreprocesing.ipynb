    " [Data preprocessing](http://www.cs.ccsu.edu/~markov/ccsu_courses/datamining-3.html) is a crucial step for any data analysis problem.  It is often a very good idea to prepare your data in such way to best expose the structure of the problem to the machine learning algorithms that you intend to use. This involves a number of activities such as:\n",
